        <h2>Welcome to St Gerald's College</h2>

        <p>On behalf of our entire school community, I welcome you to our website. We hope that it gives you a flavour of our school and all that it has to offer. On my own behalf, it is an honour to serve as Principal of a school which is synonymous with academic excellence, whilst always catering to the holistic development of its students, through its wide range of extra and co-curricular activities. All of this is done in a caring and nurturing environment, where we aim for each, and every student be given the opportunity to be their individual best.</p>
