            <p class="ex1">
                From Ancient Egyptian mummies and Ancient Roman statues to the Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece, Mona Lisa, there is something for every history enthusiast at Musee du Louvre. An iconic institution, its wealth of artefacts and displays has cemented its place as number one in our top ten historic sites of Paris list.This vast museum of art holds over 35,000 pieces from around the world and covers practically every imaginable period of history. With so much to see, it’s worth planning your route ahead and hiring one of their audio guides – although beware, these are limited and run out quickly.

            <p class="ex1">
                An iconic landmark and an indispensable element of Paris’s skyline since the nineteenth century, the Eiffel Tower was named after Gustave Eiffel, who designed it as part of a competition to create a monument for Paris’ Universal Exhibition World Fair.Today, this 314 metre-high iron structure is a fantastic place from which to get a bird’s-eye view of Paris.

            <p class="ex1">
                For those who like a little ghoulishness thrown in with their sightseeing, the Catacombs of Paris are the perfect place to go. In the eighteenth century, these former mines were transformed into a labyrinth-like subterranean graveyard, now housing over six million human skeletons.These catacombs tell the myriad of stories of those who were buried here, such as those who perished in the riots of the French Revolution. As long as you’re relatively fit (able to climb 83 steps) and don’t suffer from claustrophobia, this is definitely one not to miss.

            <p class="ex1">
                This stunning gothic cathedral was first built in 1163 and is famed for its beautiful stained glass windows, grand scale and dramatic architecture. Consecrated in honour of the Virgin Mary, the Notre Dame Cathedral of Paris is also home to the Crown of Thorns, one of the relics of the Passion of Christ. Even in spite of the recent devastating fire, the cathedral is a must-see on any trip to Paris.

            <p class="ex1">
                In 1806, fresh from his victory at the Battle of Austerlitz, Napoleon commissioned a great monumental arch to commemorate French soldiers. The result was the Arc de Triomphe, an ornately engraved triumphal arch which chronicles France’s military victories through pictures as well as words, and is one of France’s most iconic landmarks.
