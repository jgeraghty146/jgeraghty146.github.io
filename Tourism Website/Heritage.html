              The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a heritage-listed steel through arch bridge in Sydney, spanning Sydney Harbour from the central 
              business district (CBD) to the North Shore. The view of the bridge, the harbour, and the nearby Sydney Opera House is widely regarded as an iconic 
              image of Sydney, and of Australia itself. Nicknamed "The Coathanger" because of its arch-based design, the bridge carries rail, vehicular, 
              bicycle and pedestrian traffic.<br>
              Under the direction of John Bradfield of the New South Wales Department of Public Works, the bridge was designed and built by British firm Dorman 
              Long of Middlesbrough (who based the design on their 1928 Tyne Bridge in Newcastle upon Tyne) and opened in 1932. The bridge's general design, which 
              Bradfield tasked the NSW Department of Public Works with producing, was a rough copy of the Hell Gate Bridge in New York City. This general design document, 
              however, did not form any part of the request for tender, which remained sufficiently broad as to allow cantilever (Bradfield's original preference) and even 
              suspension bridge proposals. The design chosen from the tender responses was original work created by Dorman Long, who leveraged some of the design from their 
              own Tyne Bridge which, though superficially similar, does not share the graceful flares at the ends of each arch which make the harbour bridge so distinctive.
               It is the eighth longest spanning-arch bridge in the world and the tallest steel arch bridge, measuring 134 m (440 ft) from top to water level. 
               It was also the world's widest long-span bridge, at 48.8 m (160 ft) wide, until construction of the new Port Mann Bridge in Vancouver was completed in 2012.

              Bondi Beach is a popular beach and the name of the surrounding suburb in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Bondi Beach is located 7 km (4 mi) east of the 
              Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Waverley Council, in the Eastern Suburbs. It has a population of 11,656 residents. 
              Its postcode is 2026. Bondi, North Bondi, and Bondi Junction are neighboring suburbs. Bondi Beach is one of the most visited tourist sites in Australia.<br>
              Bondi Beach is about 1 kilometre (0.6 mi) long and receives many visitors throughout the year. Surf Life Saving Australia gave different hazard ratings to 
              areas of Bondi Beach in 2004. While the northern end has been rated a gentle 4 (with 10 as the most hazardous), the southern side is rated as a 7 due to a 
              famous rip current known as the "Backpackers' Rip" because of its proximity to the bus stop, the fact that many backpackers and tourists do not realise that 
              the flat, smooth water is a rip, and quite dangerous, and the unwillingness of tourists to walk the length of the beach to safer swimming. The south end of the 
              beach is generally reserved for surfboard riding. Yellow and red flags define safe swimming areas, and visitors are advised to swim between them.

              The Rocks is a suburb, tourist precinct and historic area of Sydney's city centre, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. 
              It is located on the southern shore of Sydney Harbour, immediately north-west of the Sydney central business district.<br>
              The Rocks became established shortly after the colony's formation in 1788. It was known as Tallawoladah by the Cadigal people. 
              The original buildings were first traditional vernacular houses, of wattle and daub, with thatched roofs, and later of local sandstone, 
              from which the area derives its name. From the earliest history of the settlement, the area had a reputation as a slum and the arriving convicts' 
              side of town, often frequented by visiting sailors and prostitutes. After November 1790, many of the inhabitants were also aboriginals. 
              In 1823, the district had a population of about 1,200. During the late nineteenth century, the area was dominated by a gang known as the Rocks Push. 
              It maintained this rough reputation until approximately the 1870s.
              By the early 20th century, many of the area's historic buildings were in serious decay. In 1900, bubonic plague broke out, 
              and the state government resumed areas around The Rocks and Darling Harbour, with the intention of demolishing them and 
              rebuilding them. More than 3,800 houses, buildings and wharves were inspected and hundreds demolished, but the continuation of these plans were brought to a 
              halt due to the outbreak of World War I. During the 1920s, several hundred buildings were demolished during the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

              A perfect place to catch sunrise or to cool off on a hot sunny day. Bronte Baths Sydney was one of our favourite spots, so here's a guide to visiting.<br>
              Bronte Baths are located to the far right hand side of Bronte Beach.
              The best way to get to Bronte Baths from the city is to catch the train/bus to Bondi Junction and switch to the 379 local bus.
              If you are visiting Sydney and the surrounding regions, an Opal card is the most convenient and affordable way to pay for your fares on public transport.<br>
              You can use an Opal card on the metro, train, bus, ferry and light rail services. 
              The other option if you're short for time is to grab an Uber, which are super easy and convenient to use for getting around Sydney.
