      <h1><u><b>Sydney</b></u></h1>
      <p>Sydney is quite an iconic city in today's world, taking it's place in the South East of the 'Land Down Under'.Some of the numerous icons within this city include the Sydney Opera 
        House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The city spans an area of 12,368km<sup>2</sup>, and within this area is where around 5.3 million 'Sydneysiders' live.<br></p>
      <p> The modern history of the city of Sydney began with the arrival of a First Fleet of British ships in 1788 and the foundation of a penal 
        colony by Great Britain. From 1788 to 1900 Sydney was the capital of the British colony of New South Wales. An elected city council was established in 1840.
      <br>
      Sydney is named after Lord Sydney, who was British home secretary when Captain Arthur Phillip and the First Fleet arrived in January 1788. 
      In a letter, Phillip described the colony in Sydney Cove as having “the finest harbour in the world” in which “a thousand sail of the line may ride in 
      the most perfect security”.
